This is my mod for Quake 2!

A quick overview; this mod is loosely based on Titanfall 2.
It changes a few of the guns, adds a new map, and has some
enemies drop special upgrades that can boost your weapons.

Guns:
Blaster -> Wingman
Machine Gun -> R-99
Shotgun -> Eva-8
Railgun -> Charge Rifle
Rocket Launcher -> SMR

Move around the map and kill the enemies constantly
spawning in till you're bored.



1. To run this mod, download the folder named 'Quakefall'.

2. Navigate to your Quake 2 installation, whether it be
the original or the RTX version on Steam, and move the
quakefall folder into that directory.
ex: .../steamapps/common/Quake 2/
^^^ Put it in this directory ^^^

3a. If you are on Steam, go to your library page for Quake 2.
Click the gear icon on the right (or right click the game
in your list) and click on properties. You should see a
menu for general options, and at the bottom of that menu,
a section for 'Launch Options'. Paste this line in there:
'+set game quakefall +map quakefall +set deathmatch 0'

3b. If you aren't on steam, create a desktop shortcut to your
Quake 2 executable. Right click on the shortcut and click
'Properties'. You should see the label 'Target' followed
by the path to the executable on your system. Go to the
very end of that path (past the quotes), add a space, and
paste this:
'+set game quakefall +map quakefall +set deathmatch 0'
Its the same line as steam.

Now just run your game normally, and you'll be in the
game playing the mod!
